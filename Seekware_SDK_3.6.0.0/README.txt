See LICENSE.txt for the full licensing terms of this SDK.

This SDK package includes unmodified copies of the following third party open source software components: libusb, SDL2. 
Each of these components have their own license. Please see the relevant sections of LICENSE.txt and CREDITS.txt.

-----------------------------------------------------------

In this package you will find:
--Build variants of the Seekware library fo x86, armv8, and armv7 hosts running both Linux and Windows.
--The public interface definition of the Seek SDK library.
--Several sample apps that demonstrate functionality of the Seekware SDK library. Source code and pre-compiled binaries are included. A MSVC project can be generated for the sources using CMake. See section ("Building with CMake" below).
--A Signed device driver for Windows hosts, udev rules for Linux hosts.

Driver Installation:
Windows 10:
	1) Disconnect all Seek Cameras from the host PC.
	2) Navigate to driver/win32 in the SDK package.
	3) Right click on seekusb.inf and select "Install"
	4) If installation is successful Seek cameras will be identified in Windows Device Manager under Universal Serial Bus devices as "Seek Thermal Camera"
Windows 7, 8, 8.1:
	1) Disconnect all Seek Cameras from the host PC.
	2) Open Windows Device Manager and locate the "PIR Thermal Camera" entry under "Other Devices"
	3) Right Click on PIR Thermal Camera and select "Update Driver"
	4) Select the option "Browse for drivers on your computer"
	5) Set the path in "Search for drivers in this location" to drivers/win32 in the SDK package.
	6) If installation is successful Seek cameras will be identified in Windows Device Manager under Universal Serial Bus devices as "Seek Thermal Camera"
NOTE: Some Seek Cameras will enumerate as both a "Seek Thermal Camera" and "Seek Thermal Camera (iOS)" with the version 4.0+ driver. This is normal behavior on Windows hosts.
Linux:
	1) Disconnect all Seek Cameras from the host PC.
	2) Install the udev rules provided in the SDK package:
		sudo cp driver/udev/10-seekthermal.rules /etc/udev/rules.d
		sudo udevadm control --reload
NOTE: If your Linux system is built without udev, you can still use Seek Cameras with the SDK, however, please note the following:
	1) The application that uses libseekware.so must run as root so that libusb-1.0.so can issue commands to the camera.
	2) Older Seek Camera firmware may need to be power cycled (disconnected and reconnected) if there is >20s between closing and re-opening the device. 

Installing the SDK Libraries on Linux:
	1) Follow the driver installation instructions above.
	2) Download the SDK dependencies:
		sudo apt-get install libusb-1.0.0-dev
		sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev
	3) Run the pre-compiled sample apps in bin/<ARCH>, or use CMake to compile the examples. All executables in bin/<ARCH> have RPATH set such that they can be run in place.

Building with CMake:
The SDK package includes CMake scripts that will automatically generate Unix makefiles or a MSVC project for the SDK sample apps.
The CMakelists included in this SDK package requires version 3.10+.
The latest version of CMake can be downloaded here: https://cmake.org/download/ or installed with a package manager on Linux (sudo apt-get install cmake)
Windows:
	1) Open the CMake GUI tool
	2) Click "Browse Source" and navigate to the examples folder in the SDK package.
	3) Click "Browse Build" and navigate to your desired build folder.
	4) Click "Generate"
	5) Follow the on-screen dialogue for selecting the version of Visual Studio and compiler you wish to target.
	6) When generation is complete, Click "Open Project".
	7) The generated MSVC solution will contain projects for each SDK sample app, each SDK dependency, and the source code to a C# wrapper for accessing the C dll from managed code.
	
NOTE: CMake can also be used from the command line. You may issue to the following commands to perform an out-of-source build:
	cd examples
	md build
	cd build
	cmake -G "Visual Studio 16 2019" ..\
	cmake --build . --config Debug

Linux:
	1) Follow the instructions above for installing the SDK on Linux hosts.
	2) Run cmake and make
		cd apps
		mkdir build
		cd build
		cmake ../
		make
